## Match Overview

Tonight's match against Beta Squad was a tough one. We came into this game confident after our recent win, but Beta Squad proved to be a formidable opponent. The match was close throughout, ultimately ending 13-16 in their favor.

## First Half (CT-Side)

We started on CT-side, which is typically our stronger side on Mirage. However, Beta Squad's aggressive T-side style caught us off-guard in the opening rounds.

**First Half Summary:**
- Lost the pistol round to a well-executed A ramp rush
- Struggled to hold mid control early on
- AlexBG's anchor play on B kept us in the game
- Closed the half 6-9, better than it could have been

## Second Half (T-Side)

Switching to T-side, we knew we needed a strong start. We won the pistol round with a fast B split, giving us hope for a comeback.

**Second Half Highlights:**
- Won T-side pistol with excellent utility usage
- FuzzyHat entry fragging was on point (15 T-side kills)
- Successfully executed default setups and mid takes
- Tied the game at 12-12 before losing crucial rounds

## Critical Moments

**Round 25 (12-12):** This was the turning point. We had a 4v3 advantage post-plant on A site, but poor crossfire setups allowed Beta Squad to retake. Losing this round with a man advantage was costly.

**Round 27 (13-14):** Eco round that we almost won. Got the bomb plant but couldn't hold against their retake. A win here would have evened the score.

## Individual Performance

- **FuzzyHat**: 23-19 K/D, 1.28 HLTV Rating - Strong entry fragging
- **h0t_s0up**: 18-20 K/D, AWP struggled against their aggressive peeks
- **GUNK**: 20-18 K/D, consistent throughout
- **kiwi**: 15-21 K/D, tough game but stayed positive
- **AlexBG**: 19-17 K/D, clutch B site holds kept us competitive

## What Went Wrong

1. **Mid Control** - Lost mid control 70% of the rounds, limiting our options
2. **Retake Positions** - Poor crossfire setups on retakes cost us key rounds
3. **Economy Management** - Forced buys in Round 18 and 22 hurt our momentum
4. **AWP Pressure** - Struggled to neutralize their AWPer on mid

## What Worked

Despite the loss, several positives emerged:

- Entry fragging was excellent when we got mid control
- B site holds were solid all game
- Team morale stayed high even when down
- No tilting or finger-pointing during tough rounds

## Lessons Learned

This loss, while disappointing, provides valuable learning opportunities:

1. **Adapt Faster** - Need to counter aggressive mid plays earlier
2. **Retake Protocols** - Practice crossfire setups for A site retakes
3. **Economic Discipline** - Stick to the plan, avoid panic force buys
4. **Utility Timing** - Some of our smokes were too early/late

## Moving Forward

Every loss is a chance to improve. We'll review the demo together, focus on our retake protocols in practice, and work on mid control strategies.

The score was closer than the previous matches against Beta Squad, showing we're improving. We'll get them next time.

**Next Practice:** Focus on retake setups and mid control
**Next Match:** vs Gamma Gaming on Inferno - December 15th

Keep your heads up team. We're getting better every match.
