    <!-- Application Structure Plan: 
        The SPA uses a top-level tabbed navigation to switch between major sections of the report: Overview, Principles, Roles, Default Setup, Transition, Executes (A & B), Advanced, and Conclusion. 
        - 'Overview' provides the introduction from the report.
        - 'Principles' covers core concepts like map control and utility.
        - 'Roles' features interactive buttons for each player role (IGL, AWPer, Entry, Support, Lurker), revealing detailed descriptions, responsibilities, and playstyles upon clicking. This allows focused learning on individual roles.
        - 'Default Setup' details initial positioning and essential early-round utility.
        - 'Transition' explains the decision-making process from default to an execute.
        - 'Executes' is further divided into 'A Site' and 'B Site' sub-tabs, each presenting specific strategies and utility tables for clarity.
        - 'Advanced' offers further tips, and 'Conclusion' summarizes the report.
        This thematic, tabbed structure was chosen for usability, breaking down the dense report into manageable, logically grouped sections. It allows users to either follow a linear learning path or jump directly to topics of interest, enhancing exploration and comprehension of the complex CS2 strategy.

            <p class="mb-4">This guide explores a default Terrorist strategy for Dust2 in Counter-Strike 2. Dust2 is an iconic map, known for its balanced design that offers deep strategic possibilities. For Terrorists, Dust2 can provide inherent advantages due to CT difficulties in holding multiple chokepoints. This allows Ts to gather info and force favorable engagements. CS2's visual enhancements emphasize precise utility and team sync.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">A strong default strategy is key in CS2. It helps establish map control, gather intel, and adapt to CT tendencies, minimizing early risks and setting up later tactical executes. Many players neglect learning utility, creating an opportunity for organized teams to improve win rates with strategic smokes and flashes. Controlling information and forcing CTs into reactive states is central to a successful T-side default.</p>

            <div class="mb-8">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-neutral-700">Understanding the Dust2 T-Side Landscape</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">Effective T-side play on Dust2 focuses on controlling key areas: Mid, Tunnels, and Long. Mid control is crucial, offering routes to both sites and enabling quick rotations. The goal isn't just territory, but gathering intel on CT setups (Long, Short, Mid, B distribution) and rotation patterns to exploit weaknesses and disrupt CT coordination.</p>
                <p class="mb-3"><strong class="text-neutral-700">Common CT Setups & How Defaults Counter Them:</strong> CTs often use a 3A (Long/Mid) - 1 Mid-to-B - 1B setup, or 1 Long, 1 Catwalk, 1 Mid, 2B. AWPs are common in Mid. T-defaults disrupt this by:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-3 pl-4">
                    <li><span class="icon-bullet"></span>Blocking sightlines with utility (e.g., Xbox smoke, Mid Doors smoke) to deny info and create safe passage.</li>
                    <li><span class="icon-bullet"></span>Pressuring multiple fronts (Long, Mid, Tunnels) to stretch CT defenses.</li>
                    <li><span class="icon-bullet"></span>Isolating sites/chokepoints with grenades to limit CT responses.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Initial utility denies CTs info, forcing them to react blindly, allowing Ts to gather precise intel and gain an advantage.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="mb-8">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-neutral-700">Emphasis on Map Control, Utility Management, and Adaptability</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">A successful default relies on:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-3 pl-4">
                    <li><span class="icon-bullet"></span><strong>Map Control:</strong> Early control of Mid, Tunnels, and Long is key, establishing presence to deny CTs info.</li>
                    <li><span class="icon-bullet"></span><strong>Utility Management:</strong> Judicious use of smokes, flashes, and Molotovs is vital. Teams need designated utility players and practiced lineups (one-way smokes, pop flashes, deep Molotovs).</li>
                    <li><span class="icon-bullet"></span><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Teams must adjust strategies based on enemy movements and gathered intel. Continuous learning is crucial.</li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-neutral-700">The Role of Patience and Information in Early Rounds</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">Patience is vital; rushing every round is often counterproductive. Holding positions (e.g., Tunnels) helps understand CT play. The most valuable intel is the location of CT rotators, enabling numerically advantageous fights (e.g., 5v2 or 5v3). Effective communication is critical for coordination.</p>
                <p>Patience, info gathering, and exploitation form a cycle. Observing CTs reveals tendencies. This informs exploitation: once a rotator is ID'd, Ts can hit the opposite site or split push, turning a 5v5 into a better fight. A default is a fluid process of probing, gathering intel, and exploiting weaknesses.</p>

                    <p>The IGL is the team's brain, dictating strategies, making mid-round calls, and adapting plans. They manage economy, prioritize utility vs. firepower, and analyze enemy tendencies. During the default, the IGL sets initial positions, calls for early utility, and processes incoming info to decide whether to execute or continue probing. Clear communication from all players to the IGL is vital.</p>

                    <p>The AWPer wields the AWP, exerting map control by holding long sightlines, stopping pushes, and punishing peeks. They can lock down areas or get aggressive picks. In a default, the AWPer often controls Mid or Long, denying CT aggression and seeking early picks. They must manage their economy carefully for the AWP.</p>

                    <p>The most aggressive player, the Entry Fragger initiates duels to open sites. They enter first, clear angles, and aim for the opening kill. If eliminated, their precise communication enables teammates to trade. They pave the way for the bomb plant. During the default, they probe CT positions, supported by utility, providing real-time intel. Requires quick reactions and aim.</p>

                    <p>The Support player enables teammates, especially the Entry, with utility and trading. They need comprehensive grenade knowledge (smokes, flashes, Molotovs). They follow the Entry to refrag. Often sacrifices better weapons for full utility. In the default, they deploy essential smokes (Xbox, Mid Doors, CT Mid to B) and prepare flashes for peeks and executes. Their utility and refrags are crucial for the Entry's success.</p>

                    <p>The Lurker operates away from the main push, seeking unexpected angles to catch enemies. They gather info on rotations and provide updates. Can flank or wait to punish rotations. During the default, they often hold passively (Tunnels, Long), observing CT reactions. Can cut off rotations or backstab if the team commits elsewhere. Requires game sense and timing. Their isolated position can create rotational traps for CTs.</p>

                <p class="mb-3">A typical T-side start involves distributing players: 1 scouting Mid, 1 controlling Tunnels, and 3 focusing on Long or preparing for a split. The main goal is early Mid control, as it allows attacks on both sites. Spawn positions can influence initial strategy (e.g., good Long spawn for Long take, good B spawn for B push). Tunnel players should establish presence, not necessarily push, to feel out CT play. Long is often an easier spot for Ts to control, aided by flashes.</p>

                        <p>Arguably the most crucial smoke. Denies AWP line from Top Mid/Short, removing info from CTs at Bottom Mid. Allows safe Catwalk movement and protects Ts moving Long to Short from CT AWPers. <br/><em>Throw:</em> From corner next to T Spawn railing, aim at building tip ahead, jump-throw.</p>

                        <strong class="text-lg text-orange-700">Mid Doors Smoke:</strong>
                        <p>Prevents CTs controlling Mid, blocking AWP peeks and pushes through Mid Double Doors. Restricts CT info on T rotations. <br/><em>Throw:</em> Typically a simple left-click from a specific position.</p>

                    <li>
                        <strong class="text-lg text-orange-700">CT Smoke (Mid to B):</strong>
                        <p>Essential to prevent CTs rotating from A from seeing Mid. Critical for B pushes via Mid/Tunnels, protecting from rotating A players. <br/><em>Throw:</em> Generally easy; remember a dark spot, aim, left-click. Can also be thrown from in front of Xbox.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-4">Mid control with utility like Xbox smoke allows pivots to A (Short) or B (Mid Doors/Window), forcing CTs to over-rotate or spread thin. This flexibility lets the IGL delay the final call. A default also pressures CT economy by forcing early utility use, impacting later rounds.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-neutral-700">Gaining and Interpreting Early Round Information</h3>
                <p>Early utility is vital for map control and denying CT info. Effective communication with precise callouts (Xbox, Mid Doors, Upper Tunnels, Long, Short, Suicide) is crucial. Observing CT utility (early flashes/smokes) reveals their setup. Listening for footsteps/gunshots gives real-time CT positions. The IGL integrates this info to understand CT defense and make strategic decisions.</p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-orange-600">Transitioning from Default to Tactical Execute</h2>
            <p class="mb-6">The shift from a default to a tactical execute is a pivotal moment, entirely guided by the information gathered. This section explains the decision-making framework, communication protocols, and how to exploit identified CT weaknesses.</p>

            <div class="mb-8">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-neutral-700">Decision-Making Framework Based on Gathered Information</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">The IGL processes intel on enemy positions, utility usage, and rotation patterns to make a mid-round call. This could be:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-3 pl-4">
                    <li><span class="icon-bullet"></span><strong>Commit to A:</strong> If CTs are weak on A or heavy on B/Mid.</li>
                    <li><span class="icon-bullet"></span><strong>Commit to B:</strong> If CTs are weak on B or heavy on A/Mid.</li>
                    <li><span class="icon-bullet"></span><strong>Mid-Split:</strong> If Mid control is strong and CTs are vulnerable to a split.</li>
                    <li><span class="icon-bullet"></span><strong>Fake:</strong> Draw rotations to one site, then hit the other.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Knowing when to rotate (fake or commit) can split defenses. This is the IGL's "dynamic decision point." The IGL's ability to read enemy economy/tendencies and exploit weaknesses depends on timely, accurate team info. Successful executes rely on the correct call based on this intel.</p>

            <div class="mb-8">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-neutral-700">Communication Protocols for Seamless Mid-Round Transitions</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">Clear, concise callouts are vital. Players must use mics and "talk as much as you can," giving continuous updates. Specific callouts (e.g., "enemy on Short," "enemy at Goose") are key for rapid info transfer. The IGL's calls must be unambiguous (target site, execute plan). Teammates must confirm understanding and readiness.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-neutral-700">Exploiting Identified Weaknesses in CT Setups</h3>
                <p>Once CT weaknesses are found, exploit them precisely. If a rotator is located, hit the opposite site (e.g., 5v5 to 5v2/5v3). If CT utility is depleted in an area, commit there. Knowing common CT positions allows effective pre-aiming and utility. A Lurker can cut rotations or backstab, especially if the main team hits the opposite site, creating numerical advantages or disrupting retakes.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Success on Dust2 as Terrorists in CS2 requires a multifaceted strategy. Proactive map control (especially Mid) is key for info and pacing. Each player role is interdependent and vital for map coverage and exploiting weaknesses. Utility is a primary tool for denying info, isolating sites, and creating advantages.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The default-to-execute transition is critical, driven by the IGL's interpretation of info and clear communication. A robust default minimizes risk and maximizes info gathering, setting up decisive mid-round calls. Flexibility and adaptability are paramount. Mastering Dust2 demands individual skill, deep strategic understanding, and seamless team coordination. Leveraging spawns, optimizing grenades, and clear communication significantly boost victory chances.</p>
